# Weekend Ray Tracer

The Weekend Ray Tracer is a legendary set of exercises by [Peter Shirley](https://twitter.com/Peter_shirley) designed to enable anyone with basic programming experience to create a simple ray tracer in one weekend. You can get the [books from here](https://raytracing.github.io/).

I use the WRT as an exercise in playing with a new language. I'm pushing
this up to github incase anyone is interested and over time I will redo the
implementations and rework the old for fun.

It's probably not that interesting to be honest, it's just me mucking about.
